# Daily.co Integration Compatibility Audit

## Executive Summary

This audit evaluates the readiness of the current codebase for a "Daily.co first" integration approach using the Pipecat framework as the foundation for voice capabilities. The assessment covers dependencies, code compatibility, and potential migration challenges.

**Overall Assessment**: The codebase requires moderate refactoring to achieve successful integration. While basic Daily.co SDK is already installed and some scaffolding exists, significant architectural changes are needed to implement the "Daily.co first" approach properly.

## 1. Dependency Analysis

### Current Dependencies

```json
"dependencies": {
  "@daily-co/daily-js": "^0.76.0",
  "axios": "^1.6.2",
  "multiparty": "^4.2.3"
},
"devDependencies": {
  "vite": "^6.2.2"
}
```

### Compatibility Findings

| Dependency | Status | Recommendation |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| `@daily-co/daily-js` | ✅ Installed (v0.76.0) | Upgrade to latest (v0.77+) for Pipecat support |
| `Pipecat SDK` | ❌ Missing | Add via CDN or npm package (exact package name TBD) |
| `vite` | ✅ Compatible (v6.2.2) | No changes needed |
| `axios` | ✅ Compatible (v1.6.2) | No changes needed |

### Required Additional Dependencies

1. **Pipecat Framework**: Not currently installed but required for the new architecture
2. **Sonnet 3.5 Integration**: API connection utilities for LLM access
3. **Cartesia TTS**: Integration for Text-to-Speech functionality

## 2. Code Structure Analysis

### Current Camera Implementation

The camera implementation in `main.js` is well-structured but tightly integrated with the current application flow. It includes:

- Video capturing and processing
- Camera selection (front/rear)
- Input mirroring logic
- Frame capture for AI processing

### Daily.co Integration Status

1. `daily-transcription.js`: Contains a preliminary implementation for Daily.co transcription but is not integrated with the main application flow
2. `voice-demo.html` and `voice-simple-test.html`: Standalone test files that reference Daily API but don't use the Pipecat framework
3. No current implementation of Pipecat framework integration exists in the codebase

## 3. Browser & Platform Compatibility

| Platform | Support Level | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| Mobile Chrome (Android) | ✅ High | Good camera access, WebRTC support |
| Mobile Safari (iOS) | ⚠️ Medium | Requires careful HTTPS implementation |
| Desktop Browsers | ✅ High | Good testing environment |

**Key requirement**: All production environments must use HTTPS for camera access (already accounted for in current implementation)

## 4. Integration Challenges

### Architecture Refactoring

1. **Inverted Dependency Flow**: The current architecture assumes camera-first, but needs to be inverted to Pipecat-first
2. **Video Pipeline**: Need to adapt current camera implementation to connect to Pipecat's visual input
3. **UI Components**: The TranscriptUI component needs to be migrated to the new data flow

### Code Conflicts

1. **Video Initialization**: Both systems currently initialize camera independently
2. **Event Handling**: Overlapping event handlers for media elements
3. **Error Management**: Different error handling strategies

### Media Stream Management

Current implementation uses `getUserMedia` directly for camera access. This will need to be adapted to work with Pipecat's framework for handling video streams.

## 5. Version & API Compatibility

| Component | Current Version | Target Version | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| daily-js SDK | 0.76.0 | 0.77+ | Check for breaking changes |
| Pipecat | Not installed | Latest | New requirement |
| Sonnet LLM | N/A | 3.5 | API format unclear |
| Cartesia TTS | N/A | Latest | Integration through Pipecat |

## 6. Recommended Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Setup & Preparation

1. Update `@daily-co/daily-js` to latest version
2. Add Pipecat SDK through appropriate installation method
3. Create basic test harness to verify Pipecat functionality in isolation

### Phase 2: Core Integration

1. Create `pipecat-manager.js` as the main orchestration layer
2. Refactor camera initialization to be controlled by Pipecat
3. Implement visual input connectors between camera and Pipecat

### Phase 3: Voice & Transcript

1. Connect Sonnet LLM through Pipecat's API
2. Implement TranscriptUI with Pipecat event listeners
3. Configure Cartesia TTS through Pipecat

### Phase 4: Testing & Optimization

1. Cross-browser compatibility testing
2. Mobile performance optimization
3. Error state management

## 7. Environment Requirements

### Development

- Node.js environment (current)
- HTTPS local development server (required for camera testing)
- Environment variables for API keys (Daily.co, Sonnet)

### Production

- Secure key management system
- HTTPS-only deployment
- Adequate bandwidth for simultaneous voice/video streaming

## 8. Next Steps

1. Create proof-of-concept with minimal Pipecat implementation
2. Develop migration strategy for current camera code
3. Update API integration points for voice services
4. Revise error handling for the integrated system
